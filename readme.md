# cpp-cmake-vcpkg-emscripten 

**cpp-cmake-vcpkg-emscripten** is a C++ project template designed for **cross-platform development**. It leverages **CMake** as the build system, **vcpkg** for dependency management, and **Emscripten** for WebAssembly (WASM) compilation. This template supports both **Windows** (via **MSVC**) and **WebAssembly** (via **Emscripten**) targets.

## Features

- 🛠 **CMake** build system with **CMakePresets** for efficient cross-platform configuration.
- 📦 **vcpkg** integration for seamless dependency management (e.g., SDL2, GLFW, etc.).
- 💻 **Windows (MSVC)** support for native application builds.
- 🌐 **WebAssembly (Emscripten)** integration for building browser-based applications.
- 🚀 Pre-configured **Visual Studio** and **VS Code** tasks for a smooth development workflow.

## Requirements

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CMake 3.30+** for modern configuration and build management
- **vcpkg** for dependency management
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or another MSVC-based compiler) for building on Windows
- **Emscripten SDK** for targeting WebAssembly
